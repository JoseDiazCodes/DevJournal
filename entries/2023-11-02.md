# My Journey as a Software Engineer: Daily Insights and Learnings

## November 2, 2023

Hello everyone, Jose Diaz here! For those who may not know me, I am an Afro Latino Software Engineer based in Boston, sharing my journey and experiences in tech. Today, I wanted to reflect on the past couple of days, both the highs and the areas I'm aiming to improve on.

### What I Learned

Yesterday was an incredibly enlightening experience as I participated in a mock interview night. Despite not preparing as much as I would have liked, I performed exceptionally well in my interviews, even earning a direct referral for when I'm ready to apply officially. This was a huge confidence booster for me. It also helped clarify my purpose in tech: striving to make technology more accessible to individuals who come from backgrounds similar to mine.

On the technical side, I dived into MongoDB, learning how to interact with databases. I tackled a bug where a thumbs-down icon was mistakenly adjusting the value of the thumbs-up icon. After some digging, I was able to resolve the issue within my serverside.js file.

### What I Got Done

- Participated in behavioral mock interviews, with positive outcomes.
- Learned MongoDB basics and database interactions.
- Fixed a bug related to icon functionality in my project.
- Continued to practice pseudocoding and understanding code before jumping into writing.

### What I Still Need to Work On

- Refining my professional links and resume to ensure they are ATS-friendly.
- Scheduling more coffee chats for networking and learning from others in the industry.

### How I Am Feeling

I'm feeling great! Each day, I feel more competent and confident in my abilities as an engineer. I'm learning to take constructive feedback and use it as a vessel for improvement.

### Challenges I Faced

While I didn't face significant challenges, the learning curve with MongoDB and backend technologies was a notable aspect of my day. However, I am excited to see my interest and skills growing in this area.
